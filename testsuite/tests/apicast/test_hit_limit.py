When having application with an application plan, that has limit on number
of hits per minute, the requests are accepted until the limit is reached.
Further requests in the same minute are denied.
When the next minute comes, the requests are again accepted.

When the request is denied the headers should contain the
'retry-after' header.
After waiting for the time in the 'retry-after' header, the request should
be accepted.
