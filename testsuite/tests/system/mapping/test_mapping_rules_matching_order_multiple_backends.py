Rewrite: /spec/functional_specs/mapping_rules_matching_order_with_multibackend_spec.rb

When having multiple backends where the path of the later is being a subset of
the previous one and same mapping is set to these backends, assure that the
traffic is correctly distributed between the backends.

When having a backend with a mapping rule with the 'last' flag set to true,
the request matching that mapping rule is not evaluated by other mapping rules.
